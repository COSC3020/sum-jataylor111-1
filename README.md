# Sums

The program to compute the sum of a list of numbers in `code.js` is incorrect
(and the tests in `code.test.js` are failing). Correct the code such that it
passes the tests.

Also, when I accepted the assignment it did not automatically create a pull request and I didn't catch that until after I changed the code, I apologize, and looking at another assignment I had to create a feedback branch, please let me know if I did anything wrong.
